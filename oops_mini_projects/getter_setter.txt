Problem statement
Suppose you have been hired to develop a simple banking application that should include basic user account functionality. The application should allow users to create an account, deposit and withdraw funds, and check their current balance.



Objective:


1- Create a class called Account with the following private properties:

 -accountNumber (string)
 -balance (number)
2- Create a getter and a setter for the balance property, which should only allow positive values. If a negative value is passed to the setter, it should return the message "Please enter a positive value for the balance".

3- Create a method called deposit() that accepts a number as an argument. The method should add the argument value to the balance property.

4- Create a method called withdraw() that accepts a number as an argument. The method should subtract the argument value from the balance property. If the argument value is greater than the current balance, the method should return the message "Insufficient balance".



Input:
const myAccount = new Account("1234567890");
myAccount.deposit(500);
myAccount.withdraw(200);
console.log(myAccount.getbalance); 


Output:
300
