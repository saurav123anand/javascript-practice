// how js works 

// there ia a thing called Execution context and it has two components 

// 1 . Memory  component (also called as variable environments)
--> this is the place where all the variables and functions are stored as the key value pair 
// ex--> a:10
// 2. code component (also known as thread of execution)--> this is the place where code is executed one line at a time.

--> js is a synchronous single threaded language.
--> synchronous single threaded means js can execute only a single command at a time in a specific order.

// WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU RUN JS CODE

--> Everything in js happend inside and execution context 

--> event loop 
1. When does the event loop actually start? - Event loop, as the name suggests, is a single-thread, loop that is `almost infinite`. It's always running and doing its job. ‚ù§Ô∏è
2.  Are only asynchronous web API callbacks are registered in the web API environment? - YES, the synchronous callback functions like what we pass inside map, filter, and reduce aren't registered in the Web API environment. It's just those async callback functions that go through all this.
3. Does the web API environment stores only the callback function and pushes the same callback to queue/microtask queue? - Yes, the callback functions are stored, and a reference is scheduled in the queues. Moreover, in the case of event listeners(for example click handlers), the original callbacks stay in the web API environment forever, that's why it's advised to explicitly remove the listeners when not in use so that the garbage collector does its job.
4. How does it matter if we delay for setTimeout would be 0ms. Then callback will move to queue without any wait? 
No, there are trust issues with setTimeout() üòÖ. The callback function needs to wait until the Call Stack is empty. So the 0 ms callback might have to wait for 100ms also if the stack is busy.  It's a very beautiful concept,
