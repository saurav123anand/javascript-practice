// how js works 

// there ia a thing called Execution context and it has two components 

// 1 . Memory  component (also called as variable environments)
--> this is the place where all the variables and functions are stored as the key value pair 
// ex--> a:10
// 2. code component (also known as thread of execution)--> this is the place where code is executed one line at a time.

--> js is a synchronous single threaded language.
--> synchronous single threaded means js can execute only a single command at a time in a specific order.

// WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU RUN JS CODE

--> Everything in js happend inside and execution context
